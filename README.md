* Key Lessons
When you store a function inside a variable, the function is executed and the result is stored inside the variable. 
If the function is supposed to be passed as an argument for another function, it is better to pass the function itself instead of the variable initially used to store it. This is because in this project, I experienced this challenge in my code whereby, everytime I passed the function to get computer and human selections, the variables used to store them kept providing the same value all through instead of calling the function afresh for another variable to be passed. 

* Using Nesting if else inside switch 
In this project, I did nest else if statements inside of a switch statement. This allowed me to achieve various things without havig to write different conditionals. By passing the human selection as the condition for the switch statement, I was able to specify the winner for every potential computer selection and consequently increment the score based on the winner.

## Overall verdict:
This project has served as a confidence booster and I am now looking forward to getting to the next section of the curriculum.
My code and problem solving skill will definitely keep on improving as I push ahead.

## Next up: Revisit the project to add UI after learning DOM
